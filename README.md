I'm interested in Javascript, Python and Java, but am constantly learning new things and expanding my knowledge.

On my profile you can find most of my completed or concept projects that I've created since I was 11, containing well over 7500 lines of code in total.

To see all of the projects, navigate to the 'Repositories' tab.

To run the code, first check if it contains Java, Python or HTML/Javascript file types, and then follow the related instructions below.


For HTML (No software required!):
  - Click on the repository name
  - Click on the big green button that says 'Code'
  - Under the options presented, click on 'Download ZIP'
  - Once the ZIP file is downloaded, open it
  - Open the folder that the zip created, and double click on the .html file (there should only be one)

For Python (Python IDE required):
  - Click on the repository name
  - Click on the big green button that says 'Code'
  - Under the options presented, click on 'Download ZIP'
  - Once the ZIP file is downloaded, open it
  - Open the folder that the zip created, and double click on the .py file (there should only be one)
  - From there, you need to run the code inside of the python IDE (development environment) that you have installed. Unfortunately this will vary based on the software used.

For Java (Java IDE required):
  - Click on the repository name
  - Click on the big green button that says 'Code'
  - Under the options presented, click on 'Download ZIP'
  - Once the ZIP file is downloaded, open it
  - Open the folder that the zip created inside of a Java IDE (development environment), such as NetBeans, Eclipse or IntelliJ. Unfortunately this procedure will vary based on the software used.
