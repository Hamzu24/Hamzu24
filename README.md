# Hamza Pereira
I'm interested in Javascript, C, Python and Java, but am constantly learning new things and expanding my knowledge.

On my profile you can find most of my completed or concept projects that I've created since I was 11, containing well over 7500 lines of code in total.

To see all of the projects, navigate to the 'Repositories' tab. To see the projects I spent the most time on, navigate to the 'Stars' tab and look at the ones which I own.
